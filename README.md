<ol>
 
 <li><b>ARITHMETIC ARRANGER</b>
   <p>Function that receives a list of strings that are arithmetic problems and returns the problems arranged vertically and side-by-side.    The function optionally take a second argument. When the second argument is set to True, the answers are displayed.</p>
 </li>
 <br>
 
 
 <li><b>TIME CALCULATOR</b>: 
   <p>Function named add_time that takes in two required parameters and one optional parameter: 
    <ul>
     <li>a start time in the 12-hour clock format (ending in AM or PM)</li>
     <li>a duration time that indicates the number of hours and minutes</li>
     <li>(optional) a starting day of the week, case insensitive</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
The function add the duration time to the start time and return the result.
If the result will be the next day, it shows (next day) after the time. If the result will be more than one day later, it shows (n days later) after the time, where "n" is the number of days later.
If the function is given the optional starting day of the week parameter, then the output  display the day of the week of the result. The day of the week in the output appear after the time and before the number of days later.</p>
 </li>
 
 
 <br>
 <li><b>BUDGET</b>:
 <p>The class "Category" allows you to create objects of different budget categories and has methods for depositing and removing amounts, transferring between categories, checking the balance and displaying the budget summary. </p>
 </li>
 
 
 <br>
 <li><b>POLYGON AREA CALCUTOR</b>:
 <p>The class "Rectangle" represents a rectangle with defined width and height. It has methods to set the dimensions, calculate the area, perimeter and diagonal, and generate a visual representation of the rectangle with asterisks. The "get_amount_inside" method returns the number of times another shape can fit in the rectangle, without rotations. 
<br> <br>The "Square" class is a subclass of "Rectangle" that represents a square with a single side. It inherits the methods of the "Rectangle" class and adds the "set_side" method to set the size of the side of the square. The string representation of a rectangle follows the format "Rectangle(width=X, height=Y)", while that of a square is "Square(side=X)".</p>
 </li>
 
 <br>
 <li><b>PROBABILITY CALCULATOR</b>:
 <p>The project consists of calculating the approximate probability of getting certain balls from a hat. The hat is represented by the class "Hat" and contains balls of different colors. The method "draw" randomly draws balls from the hat and returns them in a list. The function "experiment" performs a specific number of experiments, checking whether the balls obtained match the expected ones, and calculates the probability based on the results.</p>
 </li>
 </ol>
